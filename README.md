trade-me-api-wrapper
====================

This is a .NET library to authenticate via OAuth, and access data from Trade Me's Developer API. To get going, have a look at the examples.  The library is just being fleshed out, and some of it hasn't been documented properly yet, but it's getting there! If you want to help out, then feel free to checkout the source code and contribute!
